# Neural network orthogonality regularization

The objective of this neural network is to incorporate ideas from quantum mechanics. This project implements an xor autoencoder with orthogonality regularization on the two layers. As a result of the orthogonality regularization the layers must be square. An Everett activation function is used for the first layer. Orthogonality regularization doesn't seem to be useful. It was hoped that it would result in sparse layers.
